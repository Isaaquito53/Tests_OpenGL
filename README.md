# Tests OpenGL:

This is an OpenGL and C++ project where i will be developing some tests.

## Vendor folder:

You may download and link to your project all the libraries inside the vendor folder.

## Dependencies folder:

You should do the same as the vendor folder.

## Batch Rendering:

Some simple test don't use batch rendering because are so simple that this feature is not needed. For some things (like the Going3D test) is recommended to use batch rendering, and for all the future test I will use it.

## To Do/Fix:

- When I developed the Snake test the vertices were different, so I should fix the definition of the vertices for this test.

- Fix a texture/vertices/idk problem of the Texture2D test.

- Now I am trying to learn and understand the basics of Lights, so probably, I will be adding some Lights features to the Going3D test soon (probably, it isn't going to be the last thing that I will add to this test).
