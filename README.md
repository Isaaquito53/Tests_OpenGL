# Tests OpenGL:

This is an OpenGL and C++ project where i will be developing some tests.

## Vendor folder:

You may download and link to your project all the libraries inside the vendor folder.

## Dependencies folder:

You should do the same as the vendor folder.

## Batch Rendering:

Some simple test don't use batch rendering because are so simple that this feature is not needed. For some things (like the Going3D test) is recommended to use batch rendering, and for all the future test I will use it.

## To Do/Fix:

- Add elastic collision.

- Add newton physics.

- In the future I would like to add an object loader.

## What have I learned?:

- I should always remember that OpenGL works as a state machine (glEnable/glDisable).

- How to add controls to ImGui.

- How to change keyMap of ImGui.

- How to implement simple gravity system.

- How to implement Phong light shader.

- How to implement Materials and lighting maps with shaders.

- How to implement a picking objects system.

- How to implement a simple collision test.

- How to implement instanced rendering.

- How to implement Elastic collision.
